This demo showcases the conversation flow component of a larger platform that will allow users to create custom social networking apps without coding knowledge. The focus is on anime community apps for this demo.

## Features

- Guided conversation flow to collect app requirements
- Step-by-step interface with different question types
- Support for text input, single choice, multiple choice, and confirmation questions
- Dynamic flow navigation based on user answers
- Summary view of all selections before app generation
